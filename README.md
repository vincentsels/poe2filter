# poe2filter.com

I built an easy-to-use PoE2 custom loot filter generation website, allowing you to generate your own filter which does exactly what you want: filter out clutter you're not interested in, and highlight items you probably don't want to miss.

https://poe2filter.com

- Easy to use, nothing to learn.
- Hides items you're not interested in, only shows weapon and armour types of your choice.
- Highlights important items with a tiered beam and displays them on the minimap.
- Fully economy-tiered items.
- By default doesn't change label styles, keeping the original game's atmosphere.
- Offers extensive customization options.

You probably only want to start using these filters around halfway the campaign.

You can keep track of what's on the todo-list on this [Trello](https://trello.com/b/scO9dP72/tasks). You can find release notes and leave feedback in [this official forum thread](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3630063), or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/JbaMnwngvq).

If you like the filter and feel like showing your appreciation, spread the word, leave a message here, or you can [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/poe2filter) (so I write less bugs! ^^)
